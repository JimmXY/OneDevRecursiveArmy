# Introduction

This repository contains the thoughts and rants of a developer who belives being in a world where the One Dev Recursive Army is a constructive thought exercise about working logic in self-created flexible, yet not totally so scenarios; scenarios that are pretty common during development; both personal and commercial.

### Why isn't this a full blog?
Going content first. Let's face it; sometimes the boundaries of this [lazy programmer](./Concepts/LazyProgrammer.md) blurs into real tasks.

### Will this change developer lives?
As much as watching a Nebraskan winter ice storm changes lives on a 21st century weekend. I don't know; this is just as is; open to interpretation.
