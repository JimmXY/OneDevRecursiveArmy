# Introduction

This repository contains the thoughts and rants of a developer who belives being in a world where the One Dev Recursive Army is a constructive thought exercise about working logic in self-created flexible, yet not totally so scenarios; scenarios that are pretty common during development; both personal and commercial.

### Why isn't this a full blog?

Going content first. Let's face it; sometimes the boundaries of this [lazy programmer](./Concepts/LazyProgrammer.md) blurs into real tasks.

### Will this change developer lives?

As much as watching a Nebraskan winter ice storm changes lives on a 21st century weekend. I don't know; this is just as is; open to interpretation.

## What's this about?

Rants and thoughts, to be honest, in what _may_ be interpreted as an organized manner. The subject of these rants and thoughts would generally be programming and development related. In many scopes.

## Who are you? Why are you doing this?

I'm Hari, a software engineer by profession.

I was first introduced to a computer in middle school (1995 maybe); didn't stick much.

I was first introduced to a programming language (BASIC) in middle school (1996 or 1997 maybe); didn't stick much.

I was again introduced to a programming language (Java) in middle school (2000); didn't stick much.

_Actually_, it convinced me that my true career lay in Biology. That scene ended quickly and I began Engineering. In Electrical and Electronics.

And then, I was introduced to a software programmer at the wee end of high school (2005); he awed and inspired me. You can create things that help you do other totally useless things!

And then, I was again introduced to the "world of programming" and (yet) another programming language (C) in my undergradudate (2006); this time it stuck. Not just superglue stuck; Fevicol life-long level stuck. And I think many things contributed to this "sticking"; one of the most important being my Introduction to C professor (?) - a man who displayed passion. Exuberantly. He brimed with the kind of knowledge that was bait for the curiosity and absolute lack of giving-a-fuck attitude that the first couple of years in undergraduate college generates.

I was hooked.

I put in the effort too. But that was because I'd already been captivated by it's magicalness, and then baited and hooked by the knowledge.

That professor would speak volumes. Classes (and only a small percentage was completed by him) would begin with a quick general quip and then an almost carefully constructed plan that covered the begining of lessons. I think. Somewhere within the first few minutes, something would come up. An interesting segue to his work (he played a big (development?) role in bringing about CAP in Kerala in 2005) or something related would present itself and he'd steer; steer he would, the conversation so hard and so wild, I swear one lesson ended with a talk about something about Bell Systems and it's internal policies. I don't remember. The lesson was about Pointers in C. He _deferenced_ that lesson to oblivion. ;)

But almost everything he said was _interesting_ to me. The things he did teach; I understood. He was only teaching you the ropes. With experience. I figured I'd learn more on the side. So I _read_ a C programming book, it's name eludes me now. The internet was a scarce resource. I downloaded a bunch of free ebooks on C. Intermediate C. Advanced C. Didn't read or even open half of them. It was going good until the end of the semester.

And then, I was yet again introduced to _another_ programming language (Liberty BASIC). It came with an instruction manual in the form of a help file. `CHM` extension. It had lessons that guided you through increasingly complex concepts. It had good content and explanations. It was fueled by my thirst. I stumbled upon this as I hunted ways to quench my never ending thirst for ....... nope. That's not true. I was trolled and I didn't get it. I didn't _read_ the sarcasm of an online posting about being a hacker and clicked on a link. The rest, as they say, is a long boring journey with moments of brain melting realizations and a far more common theme of sitting on a dingy boat in the middle of a sweltering ocean. In a storm. Well, someone _may_ have said that.

It all culminated; thirteen years later, for many thoughts and ideas and broken promises to self to combine together to result in the grandest of epiphanies on a Saturday morning (okay, the time of day is a lie) - Write this shit down somewhere. _Because_, repeatedly thinking about these things day in and day out was driving me nuts and I drove myself to let it all out somewhere.

This is the somewhere.
